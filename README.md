## 👋 Hi there! I'm a programming student based in Lille, France. 🇫🇷 
<br/><br/>
I've been learning and developing applications, games, and web solutions for 6 years, both at school and on my own.

<br/>


💻 I'm currently doing a work-study program at 4urcloud (company) and SUPINFO (school), where I'm helping to develop Cloud solutions, including the Kexa project. ☁️🚀
